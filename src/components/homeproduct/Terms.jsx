      Opt out at any time so that you are always in control of your renewal options;
      24/7 security all-subscription long without interruption;
      The price offered is valid for the first year of subscription. After that, your subscription will be billed at the applicable renewal price;

The prices are subject to change, but Bitdefender will send a prior notification by email, before the automatic renewal takes place. You will receive an email notification before you will be billed, along with information regarding pricing and the extension of your subscription duration.`,
